\begin{abstract}
\TODO{Add data set used}
\TODO{Realize Spark Cluster without hadoop}
Apache Spark is a framework targeted for cluster-computing. 
The extremely fast processing of the spark makes it run 100 times
faster than Hadoop. Spark is installed natively on the 
Rasberry Pi cluster with the one master and four workers. 
The main goal is to create a spark cluster and perform the 
relevant configurations in order to compare and contrast 
the difference in performance, ease of deployment, flexibility 
and scalability on various platforms like direct installation 
on Rasberry Pi cluster, docker on Rasberry Pi 
cluster and Futuresystems Echo.

\section{Introduction}
\TODO{Write an introduction.}

\section{Technology Used}
\TODO{Describe Raspberry Pis.}
\TODO{Describe Echo.}
\TODO{Describe Spark.}
\TODO{Describe Docker still more than described here.}

\section{Docker}
 Docker is used for the performing the virtualization in order to containerize an existing program in an image.
 The image can be deployed in a centralized repository to be accessible by all the docker users
~\cite{hid-sp18-412-wikepedia}.

\section{Deployment}

The deployment process involves working towards setting up the 
Spark Cluster on multiple Raspberry Pi's. The Raspberry Pi cluster
includes one master and four workers. The first step in the 
deployment process is to burn the SD cards.

AppFog, CenturyLink's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) based on Cloud Foundry, 
empowers developers to center on writing great cloud-based applications 
without having to stress around overseeing the basic foundation. 
The result is expanded deftness and efficiency, more proficient use 
of resources and low operational overhead.

Instead of investing time provisioning servers, setting up databases, 
designing web servers or updating firewalls, AppFog clients essentially 
convey their cloud-native applications to a blazingly quick, resilient, 
multi-region PaaS. AppFog underpins the most prevalent runtimes and systems, 
programmed stack adjusting, easy-to-use application scaling, automatic 
load balancing and more. Platform-as-a-Service guarantees tremendous 
benefits to engineers who require accelerated time-to-market to meet 
todayâ€™s showcase requests, and AppFog 
delivers \cite{hid-sp18-412-century_link_appfog}.
